//for git and github

git config --global user.name "  "
git config --global user.email "  "

//in vs code 
    git clone (github repository link)
    cd (folder name)
    // create a new file(the goal is that new file pushed to github) that folder is now untracked (need to change github file before  github)

    git add (filename)
    git status  // now see the difference a green line text appear
    git commit -m "new file is now added"
    git push origin main // for push to the github(main branch)

    //again same process for delete the file (just delete  the file here) after that 1.git add filename 2.git commit -m "deleted" 3. git push origin main ,,, here the add name is not mean as adding new file on the folder,it representing stageing area

    //if i created file in github page now i need to get that file in my vscode so .the command is 
    
    git pull
2.// this is part two

// now the task is create a folder and files in local system and push to github directly
    cd .. //for back to folder
    git init
    git status
    git add . //represent the if i edited 100 files ,icant add and commit all files, so use dot to add all untracked files
    git commit -m "commit message"
    //now we cannt directly push the files to github becz ,we dont have repo on there,if we try  to push it shw error
    git remote add origin "link of repo u created"
    git branch // it ill show * master
    git push origin main // this case shows error
    // you can handlle this is two ways 
     1. git push origin master
     2.git branck -M main // changing the name of origin
    //now you can use the  normal code ,i changed the origin name master to main
    git push origin main
    git branck -a // listing repos in my branch
    git checkout (branckname) // for moving one to another branch
    git diff (branch name) // show the difference between two branches
    // this branch is for collabrative works ,asigned to seperate peoples,they done the work and push the file on corresponding branch ,after the verfication the admin add to the main branch
    git merge (branchname eg: main) //if you are in onther branch (after merge puss the files to desired branch)

    //in high development project they wont give main branch  access in that cause we meet pull request option
    //git conflict means simulteeuously summit the changes from various branched lead to collabse the gitup
    // if two persons works the code if 1person summited the work,but the 2nd person start the work tooo late,in that cause the 2person need too pull the main branch,because the 1person already finished there work and push to main branch,so i pull the code from main branch..
    git pull orgin main// this is command to get the main branch files to desired persons

Git and GitHub Complete Guide
1. Configuring Git
Before using Git for the first time, it's essential to configure your user information, like name and email. This information will be used for every commit you make.

Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
2. Cloning a Repository in VS Code
To clone an existing repository from GitHub and work on it locally:

Open Visual Studio Code.

Use the terminal to run the following command to clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <github-repository-link>
Change the directory to the cloned repository:

bash
Copy code
cd <folder-name>
Create a new file within this folder. At this point, the new file will be untracked by Git. To track it, you need to add it to the staging area.

3. Adding, Committing, and Pushing Changes
After creating or modifying a file, follow these steps to push changes to GitHub:

Stage the file:

bash
Copy code
git add <filename>
Check the status:

bash
Copy code
git status
You will see the file in green, indicating it is staged.

Commit the changes:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Push the changes to the GitHub repository (main branch):

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
4. Deleting a File and Pushing the Changes
If you want to delete a file and reflect that change in the repository:

Delete the file locally.
Stage the changes:
bash
Copy code
git add <filename>
Commit the changes:
bash
Copy code
git commit -m "deleted"
Push the changes to GitHub:
bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Note: The git add command here is used to stage changes, not to add a new file.

5. Pulling Changes from GitHub
If you create or modify a file directly on the GitHub page, you can update your local repository to match the remote repository using:

bash
Copy code
git pull
6. Creating a Local Folder and Pushing to GitHub
To create a new folder and files locally and push them directly to a new GitHub repository:

Navigate to the parent directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ..
Initialize a new Git repository:

bash
Copy code
git init
Check the repository status:

bash
Copy code
git status
Stage all changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
The . symbol adds all modified and untracked files to the staging area.

Commit the changes:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Add a remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <link-of-new-repo>
Push changes to the repository: You might encounter an error if you push directly to the main branch. Use one of the following methods to fix it:

Push to the master branch:

bash
Copy code
git push origin master
Or rename the branch to main:

bash
Copy code
git branch -M main
git push origin main
7. Working with Branches
Branches allow you to work on different versions of a project simultaneously.

List all branches:

bash
Copy code
git branch -a
Switch between branches:

bash
Copy code
git checkout <branch-name>
Show differences between branches:

bash
Copy code
git diff <branch-name>
Merge branches:

bash
Copy code
git merge <branch-name>
After merging, push the files to the desired branch.

Branches are useful for collaborative work, where each person works on a different branch and pushes changes after verification.

8. Handling Pull Requests and Conflicts
In larger projects, developers often use pull requests for code review before merging into the main branch. Conflicts can occur when multiple changes are submitted simultaneously. To resolve conflicts:

Ensure your branch is updated by pulling the latest changes:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
Resolve any conflicts manually and then commit and push the resolved changes.

Pull requests ensure code quality and prevent conflicts when integrating changes from multiple contributors.

9. Understanding Git Conflicts
A Git conflict occurs when multiple people make changes to the same part of a file or branch simultaneously. If the first person submits their changes, the second person needs to pull the latest changes before pushing theirs:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
This will ensure they are working with the most recent version and reduce the chances of conflicts.
